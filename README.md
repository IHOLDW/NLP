# NLP Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects** implemented using **Jupyter Notebooks** and **Python**. Each folder represents a distinct project that explores different techniques and models in NLP, ranging from text analysis to language generation.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Automatic Speech Recognition**
This project implements a **CNN-RNN based model with CTC loss** for **speech-to-text** prediction. It converts audio speech signals into text, demonstrating the use of deep learning in speech recognition.

### 2. **Machine Translation using RNN**
A project that utilizes **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** with an **encoder-decoder architecture** and an **attention block** to translate text from **English** to **Hindi**. This showcases the application of RNNs in language translation.

### 3. **Machine Translation using Transformer**
An extension of the machine translation project, this implementation replaces the RNN block with a **complete Transformer encoder-decoder architecture**. The **Transformer** model demonstrates superior performance in translation tasks due to its attention mechanism.

### 4. **Text Classification**
This project explores **three different approaches** for **text classification** (positive/negative sentiment): using **Transformers**, **RNNs**, and **learnable embeddings**. It evaluates how each technique can classify text based on sentiment.

### 5. **Trigger Word Detection**
This project implements **trigger word activation**, where the model detects specific trigger words in audio or text. For this project, the word **"activate"** is chosen as the trigger word, illustrating the concept of using certain words to trigger actions.
